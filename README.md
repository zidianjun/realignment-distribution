Discussion

(1) -1/-2 realignment is useless. Specifically, success rate in -2 realignment is exactly the same as that in participating an Olympics held by the other. 

(2) 0 realignment has great fluctuations. Even though the expection is 3.2 times (taking Mexico as an example) and 4.1 times (for Cuba), it is still below the expectation of the 1-Op-1-Vp value model.

(3) Overcontrol is roughly equivalent to control of an adjacent country.
